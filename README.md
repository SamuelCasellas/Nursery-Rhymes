# DATABASE:
[Options available (StackOverflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44376002/what-are-my-options-for-storing-data-when-using-react-native-ios-and-android)
[Picking a database to use for my app (YT)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxyvPltvvBE)
Options to look at:
- Firebase [pricing](https://www.quora.com/How-many-visitors-does-Firebase-support-in-free-and-paid-plans-Is-Firebase-costly): Online storage OR Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
- [Realm Database](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86kq_6nNuwU) (open source and free!)

(What about MongoDB? It would be good to use this since the tutorial used it)

What to store:
- Assets (asset folder: this will be the same for everyone):
  - A select number of songs for normal speed (local data)
  - Any self-made logos and icons
- Paulstretch songs (Large data - store on server)
- Videos for the About and Support My Child page (Large data - store on server)
- Playlists that the user made (Virtually nothing, should be available without internet connection - local data)
